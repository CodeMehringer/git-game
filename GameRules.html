                <h2>Game Rules</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. There are 4 player spots labeled with 4 different colors.</li>
                    <li>2. Each player has 4 game pieces.</li>
                    <li>3. Each player takes turns drawing cards until a 2, 12, or "UH OH" card is drawn.</li>
                    <li>4. A 2 or 12 gets the player out of start and then it is the next player's turn. </li>
                    <li>5. The "UH OH" can be used if another player has a game piece on the board that is not in a
                        safety zone.
                    </li>
                    <li>6. When a player draws a card, the directions for that card will be displayed and the player
                        chooses
                        which game pice to move and moves it according to the directions.</li>
                    <li>7. If it is not possible for a player to move any of their game pieces the turn is over and
                        moves to the
                        next player.</li>
                    <li>8. If you land on another players game piece or run into it during a slide, that player' game
                        piece
                        returns to their start where a 2, 12 or sorry is needed to get out again.</li>
                    <li>9. Players need to be able to take turns intermittently and be let known when it is their turn.
                    </li>
                    <li>10. Players can only enter the safe zones and home of their own color. If a player is in their
                        safezone,
                        their game piece cannot be removed and sent to start.</li>
                    <li>11. The game is over when a player gets all 4 game pieces to HOME</li>
                </ul>
